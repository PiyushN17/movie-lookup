By entering the name of a movie or TV show into the search bar, users can retrieve detailed information, including the title, year of release, genre, IMDb rating, director, actors, plot summary, box office performance, and more. Additionally, users can view the movie or show poster, if available.

The application provides a clean, interactive user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering seamless functionality for searching, error handling, and displaying movie details.
